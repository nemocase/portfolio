        <p>
            My background is in the creative industries. I'm a filmmaker, an award-winning playwright, and as a freelancer have written for websites
            like Rock Paper Shotgun, Eurogamer, and Fanbyte. Since 2019, I've been a scriptwriter for mobile game
            <a href="https://zrx.app/" target="_blank" class="link">Zombies Run</a>. Other interests of include history (my undergrad degree), food,
            photography, and visual design, and I've published my own text-based games on itch.io. In my spare time, I'm learning Spanish, with the
            aim of travelling in Spain and Latin America.
        </p>

        <p>
            I joined the Software Development bootcamp because I wanted to round out my skill-set with more tech proficiency. As a freelancer, it's also
            been several years since I worked a regular nine to five, and I felt that twelve weeks of full-time learning would demonstrate my ability to
            do so.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thanks to my experience with visual design and editing, front-end development has come relatively easily. Though I'm much less confident with
            back-end code, I've found that providing an elegant, user-friendly interface often requires shifting all the hard work backstage, so I've spent
            a lot of time strengthening my knowledge of Javascript and Python. I'm most proud of my Conjugator website, which combines what I've learned
            from the Development bootcamp with what I've learned from my Spanish course.
        </p>

        <p>
            With the bootcamp complete, I'm now looking to find a more permanent job in the creative industries, or in sectors like videogame development
            where art and tech overlap. While I don't think a pure coding job is the right fit for me, I'm certain my newfound skills will be an asset to a
            more media or people-focused role.
        </p>
