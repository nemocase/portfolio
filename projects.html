        <div class="textBox">
        <p>
            A website that randomly selects a Spanish verb from a JSON list, conjugates it, and displays the result to the user.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wanted to make a tool that I would find useful. As I'm currently learning Spanish, I decided on a revision aid. The basic idea was to create something like a digital flashcard that could test the user
            on Spanish verbs and their conjugations.
        </p>
        <p>
            The site uses JSON to store a list of verbs. Each verb has three properties:
            <ol>
                <li>The infinitive form (e.g. "hablar")</li>
                <li>The meaning (e.g. "to speak")</li>
                <li>Whether the verb is regular or irregular</li>
            </ol>
            The JSON list is imported as an array as soon as the page starts. When the user clicks 'Random Word', a random number generator selects a verb from
            the array; another function processes it based on the 'regular' property.
        </p>
        <p>
            Regular verbs follow predictable patterns, so their 'regular' value is simply "reg". Verbs with that value are passed to another function which
            conjugates the yo, t√∫, usted, nosotros, vosotros, and ustedes forms depending on the last two letters of the verb (<i>-ar</i>, <i>-er</i>, or <i>-ir</i>).
            The result is then passed to a display function which writes them into the HTML table, then makes the table visible. Irregular verbs conjugate in individual 
            ways, so their conjugations are stored under 'regular', and are simply passed to the table as is.
        </p>
        <p>
            To avoid repetition, each time a random verb is selected, it's added to a 'previous word' array. Newly generated verbs are checked against the array; 
            if there's a match, another random verb is chosen instead. Once the array exceeds 5 words, the first word is dropped; the limit was chosen arbitrarily,
            but I found that if the array gets too long the code doesn't like it (though it still functions).
        </p>
        <p>
            As well as selecting a random word, the website can conjugate any regular Spanish verb from an infinitive (hablar, comer, vivir etc) that the user enters.
            However, this simply applies the conjugation function to the input; at present it has no way of checking whether the input is a real Spanish word. A third
            function was added to test the user, but while functional, it doesn't yet work as intended.
        </p>

    <h2>Pomodoro</h2>
    <p>A website with a timer based on the Pomodoro Technique. The timer counts 4 cycles; each cycle consists of a 25 minute work segment and a 5 minute break. After 4 cycles, the session is complete.</p>
    <p>I use the Pomodoro Technique to make sure I take regular breaks from the screen, so this was another project directly useful to me.</p>
    <p>When started by the user, the timer should count 25 minutes; announce a break; count a further 5 minutes; and update the cycle count.</p>
    <p>This process should loop until the cycle count hits 4, at which point the count resets and the clock stops.</p>
    <p>Currently I have the code working in Python, but I'm trying to get it working in JS, so it's easier to integrate into a website.</p>

    <h2><a href="snake.html">Snake</a></h2>
    <p>The classic Snake videogame, made in Python. I followed a YouTube tutorial to create it. The code is hosted on trinket.io as a Python game.</p>
